# What I've Learned from 20 Years of Leading Engineering Teams

## Introduction: Leadership isn't a job title, it's a system you build

Good leadership isn't about charisma or process; it's about character. It's
about **consistency**, in how you think, how you communicate, and how you show
up when things get hard.

Over the last twenty years, I've led engineering teams in early startups,
mid-stage growth companies, and large organizations navigating transformation.
I've worked across Europe and the Middle East, and I've helped shape companies
ranging from those with five engineers to those with fifty.

What I've learned is this: **Technical leadership is architecture**, not just of
systems but of people, habits, and context.

This post isn't a list of hot takes. It's the mental model I've built and
rebuilt through experience. It covers the practices I return to when teams grow,
priorities shift, and maintaining momentum feels challenging.

## Part 1: Leading is building context at every level

The bigger your team, the less your code matters, and the more your _context_
matters.

When you're hands-on, you're judged by your output. As you grow into leadership,
you're judged by your ability to **create clarity and trust**, the kind that
lets others make smart decisions without you in the room.

Let's look at three areas where this plays out.

### 1.1 Engineers don't need direction, they need context

One of the biggest mistakes I made early on was assuming I had to give answers.
Over time, I realized: **Your job isn't to direct; it's to provide people with
enough context to make informed choices**.

**Example:** At one company, we were rewriting a legacy checkout flow. Instead
of assigning tasks, I walked the team through:

- The business trade-offs (conversion vs. feature parity)
- The user pain points from support tickets
- The rollout strategy and timelines

I then gave them the room to own the architecture, implementation, and rollout
plan.

The result? A more resilient solution than I would've come up with alone, and a
team that felt deeply connected to the outcome.

### 1.2 Feedback isn't a ritual; it's infrastructure

You can't scale teams without feedback loops. I'm not talking about annual
reviews. I mean real-time, honest, working-as-we-go feedback.

What that looks like:

- Engineers get feedback from peers and PMs in weekly demo sessions
- Tech leads get feedback from me in regular 1:1s, not just about delivery, but
  about communication, cross-team impact, and growth
- I get feedback from my reports, my peers, and the metrics, not just velocity
  but attrition, rework, and team health

This turns feedback into infrastructure. Everyone understands their own position
clearly. Nobody gets surprised. And minor issues stay small.

### 1.3 If you want high performance, make it safe to be wrong

This one took me a while.

I used to think high performance came from pressure. Deadlines, urgency, stretch
goals. That works for a while until it doesn't.

The best teams I've worked with were fast **because they felt safe**:

- Safe to raise flags early
- Safe to question decisions
- Safe to suggest weird or risky ideas

Psychological safety isn't about being soft. It's about creating the conditions
for genuine engineering rigor: early problem detection, honest debate, and a
willingness to set aside ego when it's time to roll back.

## Part 2: The shape of leadership changes as the team scales

Leading five engineers is not the same as leading fifty. Your role shifts from
building things yourself to building **systems of people** who build things.

Here's how I think about those transitions.

### 2.1 Early stage: You lead by example

When a team is small, credibility stems from the individual contributions of its
members. You're coding, reviewing, pairing. Every decision is visible.

What matters most is **pace and trust**. You're setting the bar for quality and
behavior, whether you realize it or not.

At this stage, I focus on:

- Writing clean, self-explanatory code others can learn from
- Narrating my thinking during architecture discussions
- Making onboarding and documentation part of the product

It's not "leadership" in the classic sense; it's modeling. And that's enough at
the start.

### 2.2 Mid stage: You lead through delegation and structure

When you hit 15â€“30 engineers, things change fast. You can't be in every
decision. And you shouldn't be.

However, here's the mistake I've made: promoting tech leads too quickly without
providing them with real support.

So now I do things differently:

- I define expectations for new leads (technical, team, product impact)
- I set up regular peer sessions to normalize asking for help
- I give them ownership before giving them people, starting with project
  leadership

This is where you start architecting not just systems but org design.

### 2.3 Later stage: You lead through alignment

Once you've multiple teams, your main job is to ensure everyone is pulling in
the same direction and not stepping on each other.

What that means:

- Keeping a consistent layer of principles across teams (e.g., our approach to
  testing, service ownership, documentation)
- Creating shared rituals (like quarterly architecture syncs or demo days)
- Making space for healthy tension between speed and scale, product and
  platform, autonomy and consistency

Alignment isn't about central control; it's about shared mental models that
allow distributed ownership.

## Part 3: Hard lessons I carry with me

The biggest leadership lessons often come from things you wish you'd done
differently. Here are a few I still think about.

### 3.1 Communication debt is real, and it compounds

In one team, we launched a microservice architecture before defining clear
boundaries. The services worked until we tried to scale the team. Suddenly,
every change required a flurry of Slack messages and a Zoom call.

We lacked clear ownership, contracts, and versioning discipline.

**What I learned:** _don't scale systems faster than you scale shared
understanding_. Invest early in naming, documentation, and expectations, even
when it feels like overkill.

### 3.2 Velocity without purpose burns people out

At one company, we were hitting all our sprint goals, but morale was dropping.
In retros, the same feedback kept showing up: "I don't know why we're doing
this."

We were moving fast, but we weren't going anywhere meaningful.

So we reset. We reconnected every squad to specific product KPIs. We brought
engineers into roadmap discussions. We eliminated a significant amount of
low-impact work.

Velocity bounced back. But more importantly, **energy and ownership came back
too**.

### 3.3 You don't scale by fixing everything; you scale by enabling others

As a leader, it's tempting to solve problems independently. It feels good. It's
fast. It feels like an impact.

But over time, it builds fragility because the team starts looking to you to be
the hero.

Now, I focus on coaching others through solving. I'll offer a framework, a
constraint, or a nudge, but I'll rarely jump in unless it's genuinely urgent.

Scaling isn't about being the most intelligent person in the room. It's about
**creating a room full of people who don't need you there to succeed**.

## Conclusion: Teams Grow When Leaders Grow

Leadership is not a static concept. Each stage of development, every company,
and the dynamics of each team will challenge you in unique ways.

However, the core responsibilities remain the same:  
**Create clarity. Build trust. Enable progress.**

If you consistently and intentionally focus on these areas, you'll foster teams
that not only achieve their goals but also flourish. You will build teams that
thrive.
